2 little prototypes for randomly generated maze based ipad games I made over a few days a couple years back, but they never went anywhere and I could use the private github slot. Maybe somebody could make use of them.

Both games are corona (www.anscamobile.com) based, but I forget the version. What I do remember is that it was an early beta copy. I haven't run these in a essentially since the date of the previous code commit, so I'm not sure how much effort they will take to port to modern corona. Since I've just found them again I may come back and put some effort into finishing them.

The 2d maze is a simple accelerometer based table tilt style game where you get a ball through a maze.

The 3d one is basically just the start of a little 2.5d ray casting game with a little control pad to move around the maze. This game also has the 2d maze built in as a full screen minimap. If I remember, movement was still in fairly early stages and I may not have added a way to get out of the minimap once it's up.
